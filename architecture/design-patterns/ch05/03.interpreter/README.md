# Interpreter

This pattern is very specialized for particular kinds of applications and I've decided not to outline its note in here. 
In addition to that, I think it's covered in a shallow way which is insufficient to understand how interpreters work.

If one is interested in learning more about how interpreters work, I'd recommend other books on this subject such as [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
