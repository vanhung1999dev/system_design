# Design a Notification System

There are multiple flavors of a notification: <br>

- Mobile push notification
- SMS
- Email

# Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope

- C: What types of notifications does the system support?
- I: Push notifications, SMS, Email
- C: Is it a real-time system?
- I: Soft real-time. We want user to receive notification as soon as possible, but delays are okay if system is under high load.
- C: What are the supported devices?
- I: iOS devices, android devices, laptop/desktop.
- C: What triggers notifications?
- I: Notifications can be triggered by client applications or on the server-side.
- C: Will users be able to opt-out?
- I: Yes
- C: How many notifications per day?
- I: 10mil mobile push, 1mil SMS, 5mil email

# Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in

## Different types of notifications

### iOS push notification

![](./images/2025-02-06_09-42.png)

- Provider - builds and sends notification requests to Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). To do that, it needs some inputs:
  - Device token - unique identifier used for sending push notifications
  - Payload - JSON payload for the notification, eg:

```
{
   "aps":{
      "alert":{
         "title":"Game Request",
         "body":"Bob wants to play chess",
         "action-loc-key":"PLAY"
      },
      "badge":5
   }
}
```

- APNS - service, provided by Apple for sending mobile push notifications
- iOS Device - end client, which receives the push Notifications

### Android Push Notification

Android adopts a similar approach. A common alternative to APNS is Firebase Cloud Messaging: <br>

### SMS Message

For SMS, third-party providers like Twilio are available: <br>

### Email

Although clients can setup their own mail servers, most clients opt-in to use third-party services, like Mailchimp: <br>

#### Here's final design after including all notification providers:

### Contact info gathering form

In order to send notifications, we need to gather some inputs from the user first. That is done at user signup: <br>

Example database tables for storing contact info: <br>

## Notification sending/receiving flow

![](./images/2025-02-06_16-37.png)

- Service 1 to N - other services in the system or cron jobs which trigger notification sending events.
- Notification system - accepts notification sending messages and propagates to the correct provider.
- Third-party services - responsible for delivering the messages to the correct users via the appropriate medium. This part should be build \w extensibility in case we change third-party service providers in the future.
- iOS, Android, SMS, Email - Users receive notifications on their devices. <br>

Some problems in this design: <br>

- Single point of failure - only a single notification service
  -Hard to scale - since notification system handles everything, it is hard to independently scale eg the cache/database/service layer/etc.
- Performance bottleneck - handling everything in one system can be a bottleneck especially for resource-intensive tasks such as building HTML pages.

# High-level design (improved)

Some changes from the original naive design: <br>

- Move database & cache out of the notification service
- Add more notification servers & setup autoscaling & load balancing
- Introduce message queues to decouple system components
  ![](./images/2025-02-06_16-49.png)

- Service 1 to N - services which send notifications within our system
- Notification servers - provide APIs for sending notifications. Visible to internal - services or verified clients. Do basic validation. Fetch notification templates from database. Put notification data in message queues for parallel processing.
- Cache - user info, device info, notification templates
- DB - stores data about users, notifications, settings, etc.
- Message queues - Remove dependencies across components. They serve as buffers for notifications to be sent out. Each notification provider has a different message queue assigned to avoid outages in one third-party provider to affect the rest.
- Workers - pull notification events from message queues and send them to corresponding third-party services.
- Third-party services - already covered in initial design.
- iOS, Android, SMS, Email - already covered in initial design. <br>

Example API call to send an email:

```
{
   "to":[
      {
         "user_id":123456
      }
   ],
   "from":{
      "email":"from_address@example.com"
   },
   "subject":"Hello World!",
   "content":[
      {
         "type":"text/plain",
         "value":"Hello, World!"
      }
   ]
}
```

Example lifecycle of a notification: <br>

- Service makes a call to make a notification
- Notification service fetch metadata (user info, settings, etc) from database/cache
- Notification event is sent to corresponding queue for processing for each third-party provider.
- Workers pull notifications from the message queues and send them to third-party services.
- Third-party services deliver nofications to end users

# Step 3 - Design deep dive

In this section, we discuss some additional considerations for our improved design. <br>

#### Some questions to consider in terms of making the system reliable:

- **What happens in the event of data loss?**
- **Will recipients receive notifications exactly once?**

### To avoid data loss, we can persist notifications in a notification log database on the workers, which retry them in case a notification doesn't go through:

- Can use kafka instead of RabbitMQ

![](./images/2025-02-06_16-55.png)

### What about duplicate notifications?

It will occasionally happen as we can't guarantee exactly-once delivery (unless the third-party API provides idempotency keys). If they don't we can still try to reduce probability of this happening by having a dedup mechanism on our end, which discards an event id if it is already seen

## Additional components and considerations

### Notification templates

To avoid building every notification from scratch on the client side, we'll introduce notification templates as many notifications can reuse them: <br>

```
BODY:
You dreamed of it. We dared it. [ITEM NAME] is back â€” only until [DATE].

CTA:
Order Now. Or, Save My [ITEM NAME]
```

### Notification setting

Before sending any notification, we first check if user has opted in for the given communication channel via this database table: <br>

```
user_id bigInt
channel varchar # push notification, email or SMS
opt_in boolean # opt-in to receive notification
```

### Rate limiting

To avoid overwhelming users with too many notifications, we can introduce some client-side rate limiting (on our end) so that they don't opt out of notifications immediately once they get bombarded.

### Retry mechanism

If a third-party provider fails to send a notification, it will be put into a retry queue. If problem persists, developers are notified.

### Security in push notifications

Only verified and authenticated clients are allowed to send push notifications through our APIs. We do this by requiring an appKey and appSecret, inspired by Android/Apple notification servers.

### Monitor queued notifications

A critical metric to keep track of is number of queued notifications. If it gets too big, we might have to add more workers: <br>
![](./images/2025-02-06_17-07.png)

### Events tracking

We might have to track certain events related to a notification, eg open rate/click rate/etc. <br>
Usually, this is done by integrating with an Analytics service, so we'll need to integrate our notification system with one. <br>

# Updated design

![](./images/2025-02-06_17-08.png)

- Notification servers are equipped with authentication and rate limiting.
- Added a retry mechanism to handle notification failures.
- Notification templates are added to provide a coherent notification experience.
- Monitoring and tracking systems are added to keep track of system health for future improvements.

# Step 4 - Wrap up

We introduced a robust notification system which supports push notifications, sms and email. We introduced message queues to decouple system components. <br>

- Reliability - added robust retry mechanism in case of failures
- Security - Appkey/appSecret is used to ensure only verified clients can make notifications.
- Tracking and monitoring - implemented to monitor important stats.
- Respect user settings - Users can opt-out of receiving notifications. Service checks the user settings first, before sending notifications.
- Rate limiting - Users would appreciate if we don't bombard them with a dozen of notifications all of a sudden.
